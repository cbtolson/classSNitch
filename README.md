classSNitch (R-randomforests-dtw)

Summary: Autonomous classifier for RNA structure change in genome-wide experimental data (R package)
- Created a survey website using HTML and PHP that collects data from human experts 
- Stored and analyzed human expert data in MySQL database
- Trained a model using random forest classification on pattern, magnitude and time-series features in R
- Used the machine learning model to predict structure change in 2000+ experimental traces
- Developed stand-alone application in R for prediction of RNA structure change
