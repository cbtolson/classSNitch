Description: Variations in RNA sequence lead to differences in RNA structure
    called riboSNitches, if important structural elements are disrupted. Recent
    ultra-high throughput techniques, such as SHAPE-MaP and PARS, enable the
    collection of structural information on RNAs at a genome-wide scale. With the
    ability to gather large amounts of structural information, it is important to
    accurately identify those structural changes that can potentially result in
    a phenotypic outcome. We have developed an automated approach to identify and
    classify structure change in chemical mapping data. This method utilizes random
    forest classification on a set of seven characterizing features. The default
    mutate and map SHAPE data sets (or another user specified data set) can be used
    to build a classifier. The classifier is then used to identify structure change
    in other SHAPE traces. Enabling scientists to identify structure change may
    help guide experiments that examine RNA structure and its role in biological
    processes.
